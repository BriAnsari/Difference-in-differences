# Difference-in-differences analysis when access to a control group is not feasible

Difference-in-Differences (DID) analysis quantifies the change in outcomes over time between two groups (treatment and control). In certain situations, it may not be possible to have a control population such as when a nationwide policy is adopted. 

The proposed DID design (DID design.pdf) can serve as a reference for DID analysis for when there is a single group available. Please note that, propensity score matching can be used to when splitting the cohort into the treatment and control arms.
