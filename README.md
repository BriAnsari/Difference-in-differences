# Difference-in-differences

## Difference-in-Differences (DID) analysis quantifies the change in outcomes over time between two groups (treatment and control). In certain situations, it may not be possible to have a control population such as when a nationwide policy is adopted. 

### The proposed DID design can serve as in creating a code for DID analysis for when there is only single group available. Please note that, propensity score matching can be used to when splitting the cohort into the treatment and control arms.
